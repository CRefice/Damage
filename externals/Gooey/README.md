# Gooey
Gooey - A minimal, easy to use, cross-platform GUI library!

Note: As of right now, the only platform supported is Windows(Win32). I plan on adding more platforms in the coming future and adding more documentation.

**Current TODO List:**
* GTK+ Support
* Win32 Custom Draw
* Support more image formats (currently only .bmp)
